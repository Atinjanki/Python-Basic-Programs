This program sorts the words in alphabetical order and also finds the number of vowels in the input string.

Logic for sorting:
1. First the input string is splitted
2. There is inbuilt option in python to sort (used here)
3. Run a loop and display all the sorted words

Logic for finding vowels:
1. Case sensitivity removed from input string
2. Each vowel is tored in a dictionary using '.fromkeys()'
3. Each vowel is counted in the input string and result is displayed
