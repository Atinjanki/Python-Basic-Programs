Birthday problem aka Birthday paradoy in probability theory is the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen 
people some pair of them will have birthdays as similar dates. The probability reaches 50% when the number of people 
are 23 and reaches almost 100% when the number of people are 70.

Logic:
1. Radomly choose n number of birthdays from a year (n being number of people, and number of days per year can be set to 365/366)
2. Calculate how many similar days have been repeated
3. Calculate the probability of having matching birthdays.
